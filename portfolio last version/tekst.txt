I started learning how to program at primary school,
                    beginning with basics of html and css. Then I realised
                    that it's what I want to do in my future so I decided
                    to go to the programming class. We used to learn C++,
                    C#, Java but its JS that interested me the most. For
                    last 2 years I used to study it on my own, even though
                    we ended to learn it in school. Also, I spent a lot of
                    time coding on codewars.com, which u can see on my 
                    github profile. Now, I feel pretty confident to find
                    first job at Web Developing.
